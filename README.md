# Smart-Feeding-System
The Smart Auto Feeding System for Cows is an AI-driven automated solution that uses computer vision, weight-based food dispensing, and ultrasonic sensors to optimize feeding. Powered by Raspberry Pi 4, it ensures precision, efficiency, and reduced manual labor in livestock management.
Core Components
QR Identification

Scans unique QR tags on cows using a camera

Verifies cow registration in database

Weight Measurement

Load cells measure cow weight

Auto-calibration for accuracy

Automated Feeder

Motor-controlled dispenser

Adjusts portions based on weight/history

Database

Tracks:

Cow profiles (ID, name, QR path)

Feeding logs (time, amount)

Weight history

Control Logic

Full cycle:

Copy
Scan QR → Record entry → Weigh → Calculate portion → Dispense → Record exit  
Dynamic food calculation (weight-based)

Hardware Integration
Raspberry Pi/Arduino as controller

USB Camera for QR scanning

HX711 Load Cells for weight

Stepper Motor for precise dispensing

Key Features
✔ Hands-free operation
✔ Portion control (prevents over/under-feeding)
✔ Data logging for health monitoring
✔ Simulation mode for testing

Output
Real-time logs (weight, food dispensed)

Alerts for low food/maintenance

Scalable – Add sensors (e.g., RFID, health monitors) or cloud connectivity.
